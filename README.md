DOCSTRING_OF_FILE

Functions:

```
function def and DOCSTRING
```

## Example Scripts

Example executable Python scripts/modules for testing and interacting with the library. These show example use-cases for the libraries and can be used as templates for developing with the libraries or to use as one-off development efforts.

### [filename](link_to_file)

```
DOCSTRING
```

## Notes

 - Relies on f-string notation, which is limited to Python3.6.  A refactor to remove these could allow for development with Python3.0.x through 3.5.x

## TODO

 - Unittest framework in place, but lacking tests
